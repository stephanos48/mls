    Our journey into the manufacture of hydraulic components started when our founder, Eric Shen, started making automotive lifts back in 1999 and wanted to control the quality of the hydraulics in the lifts. To accomplish this, he added hydraulic manufacturing capabilities to his factory in China. As a result, his automotive lift company took off and became one of the biggest in the United States and was sold off to Dover Corporation's Rotary Lift in 2006.

    After Dover's purchase of the automotive lift division, the hydraulic division remained under the founders ownership and was spun off to create United Hydraulics.

    Today, we provide components for a vast variety of customers and applications (many Fortune 500 companies included among them). Since that time the hydraulic division has undergone fantastic growth.
